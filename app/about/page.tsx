          I am a web developer with a passion for building robots. I have 4
          years of experience in web development. I have been working on web
          development projects for the past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          My true passion lies in creating robots and automating tasks. I am
          currently balancing my love for web development and robotics by
          incorporating my robotics knowledge into my web development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with
          industry trends to provide the best solutions for my clients and build
          innovative robots.
