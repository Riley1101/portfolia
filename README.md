My personal website is built using the latest version of Next.js 13 and server components. Server components is a new feature in Next.js 13 that allows me to write server-side code using React components. This helps me to create more dynamic server-side rendering and improve the performance of my website. I am always exploring new things and trying to keep my website up to date with the latest technologies and trends in web development.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone {repository URL}`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd {project directory}`
3. Install the dependencies: `pnpm install`

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
pnpm run dev

```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```
npm run test

```

This will run the tests using Jest and React Testing Library and ensure that the functionality of the blog is working as expected.
